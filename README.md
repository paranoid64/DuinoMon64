## what do I do if I don't have a C64?
There is only one emulator that can emulate the WIC64 module and of course the C64. This is the Kernal64 emulator.
The programme was also written with this emulator.

After switching on the WiC64 in the menu Settings -> I/O -> WiC64 panel the software DuinoMon64 written 
for the WiC64 as well as the original WIC64 portal can be used.

## What is the PHP file for?
The PHP file and the ASM code serve as a suggestion for implementing your own service.
The code is freely available. By free, I also mean free, i.e. free of charge.

## what is duino coin?
A simple, environmentally friendly and centralised coin. Not to make a profit, but to learn how it works. 
You learn how to program Arduinos and ESPs in C or with Python on the PC and now also with ASM on the C64 :-)

### And now have fun! :-)
