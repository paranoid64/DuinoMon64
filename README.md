## what do I do if I don't have a C64?
There is only one emulator that can emulate the WIC64 module and of course the C64. This is the Kernal64 emulator.
The programme was also written with this emulator.

## What is the PHP file for?
The PHP file and the ASM code serve as a suggestion for implementing your own service.
The code is freely available. By free, I also mean free, i.e. free of charge.

## what is duino coin?
A simple, environmentally friendly and centralised coin. Not to make a profit, but to learn how it works. 
You learn how to program Arduinos and ESPs in C or with Python on the PC and now also with ASM on the C64 :-)

### And now have fun! :-)
